# react-chat-app

This project was created for learning purposes and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## [Official website](https://react-chat-app-14bbc.web.app) âœ”

## Run app locally

Start by cloning and run:

### `npm install --no-audit`

Because of Create React App, this project has some audit warnings when running `npm install`. This should be ignored by adding `--no-audit`.

Then, run `npm start` to start on localhost:3000.
